can anybody hear me?
or am I talking to myself?
my mind is running empty
in the search for someone else
who doesn't look right through me
it's all just static in my head

can anybody tell me 
why
I'm lonely like a sate-
llite?

'cause tonight I'm lonely like an astronaut
sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
and I lost all signal when I lifted up
now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot

can I please
come down?
'cause I'm tired of drifting round
and round
can I plese 
come down?

I'm deffend by the silence
is it something that I've done?
